    <h1>Case Study Two: HCI Website Design</h1>
  </header>

  <main>

    <h2>Redesigning the Drexel Term Master Schedule Website</h2>
    <p>While taking an Intro to HCI class called INFO-110, I had the opportunity to engage in a collaborative project aimed at redesigning the Drexel Term Master Schedule website. As a team, our goal was not just to enhance the aesthetics and design of the site, but to prioritize key UX principles such as visibility, signifiers, mapping, and slips to improve the overall user experience.</p>

    <div class="image-container">
      <img 
         src="https://github.com/rem357/idm221-rem357/blob/main/compressed%20images/CS2%20Compressed/original%20TMS%20website.png?raw=true" 
         alt="original-TMS-site" 
         class="responsive-image">
    </div>

    <p>The project commenced with the formation of teams. We brainstormed ideas on how to approach the redesign of the Drexel Term Master Schedule website. We recognized the importance of understanding user needs and pain points to inform our redesign process. Through open discussions and brainstorming sessions, we identified key UX principles that needed to be addressed, including visibility, signifiers, mapping, and slips.</p>

    <p>One of the key milestones in our project was the creation of wireframes using Figma. Collaborating in real-time on the Figma platform allowed us to iterate quickly and incorporate feedback from both our team members and our instructor. We carefully crafted each screen, paying attention to layout, typography, color schemes, and interactive elements to ensure a cohesive and user-friendly design.</p>

    <div class="image-container">
      <img 
         src="https://github.com/rem357/idm221-rem357/blob/main/compressed%20images/CS2%20Compressed/before%20wireframes.png?raw=true" 
         alt="before-altered" 
         class="responsive-image">
    </div>

    <div class="image-container">
      <img 
         src="https://github.com/rem357/idm221-rem357/blob/main/compressed%20images/CS2%20Compressed/altered%20wireframes.png?raw=true" 
         alt="altered-wireframe" 
         class="responsive-image">
    </div>

    <div class="image-container">
      <img 
         src="https://github.com/rem357/idm221-rem357/blob/main/compressed%20images/CS2%20Compressed/main%20issues%20TMS.png?raw=true" 
         alt="main-issues" 
         class="responsive-image">
    </div>

    <p>Signifiers played a significant role in guiding users through the website. We introduced clear and intuitive icons and labels to indicate different functionalities, making it easier for users to understand and navigate the interface. Additionally, we paid attention to mapping, ensuring that the websiteâ€™s structure and organization followed logical patterns that users could easily follow.</p>

    <div class="image-container">
      <img 
         src="https://github.com/rem357/idm221-rem357/blob/main/compressed%20images/CS2%20Compressed/TMS%20browse%20courses.png?raw=true" 
         alt="browse" 
         class="responsive-image">
    </div>

    <p>Throughout the redesign process, we remained vigilant about addressing slips, or errors, that could occur during user interactions. We conducted usability testing on our wireframes to identify any potential usability issues and iteratively refined our designs to minimize friction points and enhance the overall user experience.</p>

    <div class="image-container">
      <img 
         src="https://github.com/rem357/idm221-rem357/blob/main/compressed%20images/CS2%20Compressed/TMS%20description%20section.png?raw=true" 
         alt="description" 
         class="responsive-image">
    </div>

    <p>We began applying UX principles to our redesign strategy. Visibility emerged as a crucial aspect, and we focused on ensuring that important information was prominently displayed and easily accessible. We revamped the layout of the website, placing key features such as course search and schedule viewing at the forefront and centered.</p>

    <div class="image-container">
      <img 
         src="https://github.com/rem357/idm221-rem357/blob/main/compressed%20images/CS2%20Compressed/TMS%20search%20courses.png?raw=true" 
         alt="search" 
         class="responsive-image">
    </div>

    <p>As the project neared its conclusion, we prepared to present our redesigned wireframes to the class. We articulated our design decisions, explaining how we had applied UX principles to address the identified pain points and improve the overall usability of the Term Master Schedule website. The feedback we received from our classmates and instructor was invaluable, providing us with fresh perspectives and insights that further refined our designs.</p>

    <p>The redesign of the Drexel Term Master Schedule website was a challenging yet rewarding endeavor that allowed us to apply theoretical concepts learned in our HCI class to a real-world problem. By prioritizing UX principles such as visibility, signifiers, mapping, and slips, we were able to create a more user-friendly interface that better served the needs of the Drexel University community. This project underscored the importance of collaboration, research, and iterative design in creating effective user experiences, and it provided us with valuable skills and experiences that will undoubtedly benefit us in our future endeavors in the field of human-computer interaction.</p>
