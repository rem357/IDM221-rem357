    <p>Hello there, I’m Riley, currently a sophomore at Drexel University majoring in User Experience and Interaction Design and on a 5-year track. I live on campus in Philadelphia, but I’m originally from Malvern, PA. I’m an active member of the Alpha Sigma Alpha sorority.</p>

    <p>I grew up in a busy household with three brothers and four pets: two dogs (Koda and Marigold) and two cats (Mango and Vail).</p>

    <p>Growing up in a loving but chaotic household helped me develop skills to simplify and organize chaos in visually appealing ways. These qualities led me to UXID. In my free time, I enjoy concerts, music, baking, cooking, movies, and running.</p>

    <p>I love the winter and skiing, and I often visit the Poconos and Quebec. I’m also passionate about photography, video editing, and music, and I love the outdoors, traveling, and hiking.</p>
