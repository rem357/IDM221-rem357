## About Me

Hello there, I’m Riley, a sophomore at Drexel University majoring in User Experience and Interaction Design. I currently live on campus in the city of Philadelphia, but I am originally from a suburb of Philly, Malvern, PA. I grew up in a very busy household with three brothers and even more pets: two dogs (Koda and Marigold) and two cats (Mango and Vail).

Growing up in a chaotic and ever-changing household helped me to learn and develop various skills that taught me I love to use my creativity to simplify, organize, and control chaos in visually appealing ways. These qualities led me to find the wonderful field of UXID. When I’m not in class, studying, working, or exploring Philly, I love going to concerts, listening to music, baking, cooking, watching movies, and going on runs.

I love winter and colder weather; I am an avid skier and have been skiing since I was six, and I enjoy making trips up to the Poconos and Quebec every winter. I also love photography, video editing, and music, often finding myself holed up for hours creating playlists or experimental edits that incorporate multiple forms of media. I love the outdoors, traveling, and hiking, always searching for cool places to seek out and explore.
